##Hemopynamic simulations

The main idea of this project is to move forward an HRF simulator, allowing diverse applications on FMRI research. Particular applications in mind for now are: 

1. Assisting power analysis for the design and replicability assessment of FMRI studies
2. Assisting preprocessing and analysis pipeline alternatives assessment
3. Assisting the challenges of metaanalysis of FMRI studies considering their high methodological variability.
